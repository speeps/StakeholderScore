# StakeholderScore
Official Version Control for the Stakeholder Score

## README

Thank you for your interest in the Stakeholder Score. The Stakeholder Score is an open-source, collaborative tool that measures the “vital signs” of an organization to ensure it is healthy, sustainable, and evolving. It is free to use, remix, share and commercialize (according to the Creative Common’s [Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International — CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)  license). It is a survey that allows stakeholders to assess an organization that it impacts and/or is impacted by. Organizations are always contextual to the stakeholder ecosystems on which they inter-depend. This assessment seeks to assess the health of those interdependencies and, thereby, the organization.

In the [medical field](https://prohealthsys.com/central/assessment/physical-assessment/vital-signs/vital_signs/), vital signs:

- Can identify the existence of an acute medical problem.
- Are a means of rapidly quantifying the magnitude of an illness and how well the body is coping with the resultant physiologic stress. The more deranged the vitals, the sicker the patient.
- Are a marker of chronic disease states

Similarly, our intention with the Stakeholder Score is to help alert and guide organizations operating out of fear, greed, or short-sightedness into becoming sustainable wealth and value creators that are expressions of the best of our humanity. In addition to the tool, we will help curate a network of domain experts as well as relevant educational content to help assist those who use the survey to develop clear action plans to improve their scores.

## HOW THIS TOOL WILL NOT BE USED
This tool is not intended to be a certification and there is no intention for a 3rd party to verify results at any time. This tool does not seek to generate revenue in any way.  This tool is not intended to be a lead generator. This tool is not designed to “compete” with other frameworks or approaches but rather to help bring organizational leaders into the fold of the broader movement for a humanistic global economy.

## HOW THE TOOL WILL BE USED
The tool is a survey that may be administered by anyone according to our Creative Commons License. We will maintain a digital version of the tool (currently hosted at [www.StakeholderScore.com](https://www.stakeholderscore.com)) and attempt to open additional channels for submitting survey results into a master database in order to compare individual results across other other organizations. Broad and anonymized trend data will be published periodically to help educate the community about the current state of most organizations using the tool.

## WHO WILL USE THIS TOOL
This tool is intended for leaders in companies, non-profits, governmental organizations of all sizes around the world. Great care has been taken to choose language and framing that does not require additional explanation and that will eventually translate well into other languages and global contexts. Getting the tool in front of those leaders will be accomplished by people like you, dear reader, choosing to incorporate it into your efforts to help leaders broaden their aspirations for what their organizations can accomplish and how they might better achieve it.

## WHO CREATED THIS TOOL?
This tool will always be evolving and the combined efforts of people from a wide range of backgrounds including c-suite executives, leaders of several “conscious” business organizations, practitioners, consultants, academics, lawyers, visionaries and many others.  We all share a common perspective:

We believe that the various languages and approaches in the conscious business, social venture, inclusive capitalism, impact investing, benefit corporation, and others share a basic common foundation. Our task is to develop and utilize a simple tool that can help anyone to understand and begin to access the world-changing potential of this broad movement for a more humanistic global economy. 

Further, we believe that this tool must be free to use, open source and iterative.  We encourage anyone and everyone to engage in debating and improving the tool and to build proprietary and profitable offers based on this foundation it provides, but to be effective as a tool that everyone in our movement can use, it is important that it is dominated by no one. It is equally important that it evolves to keep pace with new learnings, including its own strengths and weaknesses.

The following people have made a substantial contribution to making it what it is today, and  have agreed to the preceding statement of intent to use and help improve this tool over time.

Adam Melnick, Raj Sisodia, Bridget Wald, Steve Hall, Glenn Meier, Kate Hermann, Reggie Blount, Bem Joiner, Courtney Counts, Christina Anibal, China Califf, Jocelyn MacDougall, Joyce Witte, Jessica Welser, Tiffany McNeil, Khalilah Olokunola, Scott MacIntosh, Dorothy Mankey, Rehana Nathoo, Melinda Weekes-Laidlow, Keoni Lee, Jenna Morrow, Mark Christensen, Brian Mohr, Nathan Havey, Vanessa Childers, Anil Saxena, Linh Quach, Scott Peeples, Karen Sammon, Carlos Saba, Emily Winslow, Brian Sherwin, Holly Grogan, Tara Jenkins, Brie Roper

* Many of the people who helped to co-create this tool did so by participating in a 90-minute Zoom call ([watch the recording to get the full context of how this beta emerged](https://zoom.us/recording/share/uMtdjw72K_IgGTnWPsUQBlVSvSYY4fnWHCVsUy7QUnuwIumekTziMw)).

## HOW WILL THIS TOOL BE UPDATED?
The tool will be managed following the example set by other open-source projects. Anyone is welcome (encouraged in fact) to raise issues and suggest edits and revisions using this GitHub repository. Those ideas will be reviewed by a decision-making body charged with stewarding the tool. Rules for participation on that body will be determined by the members of the Co-op (once it is created) and will take effect January 1, 2021. Until that date, the following six people will serve as the decision-making body.

_(in alphabetical order)_
- Nathan Havey - Founder, Thrive Consulting 
- Tara Jenkins - Founder, Conscious Revolution
- Dorothy Mankey - Former Leadership Development Manager, Whole Foods Market 
- Brian Mohr - Conscious Capitalism, Inc. Board Member
- Scott Peeples - Co-Founder & Former COO, Peerfit
- Brie Roper - Leadership Development Manager, BIGGBY COFFEE

In addition to ongoing review and consideration of received suggestions, the decision body will organize opportunities to share learning, facilitate broadly inclusive discussion (extending well beyond co-op members to bring in substantially diverse perspectives), and update this tool in October 2019, April 2020, and at least annually thereafter.
